# gif-o-matic

Proof-of-concept for electron.js. Add a file, select parameters, make a gif.

## How to run this

Git clone and run `npm install` and then `npm start`, probably!

You will need to have ffmpeg, node.js and electron.js installed on your computer already. You also might need to be using macOS.

I will figure out how to bundle ffmpeg and make this interoperable, and then everyone can use it!
